When you log in, there will be three files of malware installing on your in-game computer. The install's can be restarted by pressing the restart button next to the download. The catch is that you will have pop-up ads on your screen and will have to close them fast enough to see the install page. Try and stop the malware from installing on your in-game computer for as long as possible.
